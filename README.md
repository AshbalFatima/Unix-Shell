__User-Friendly Interface:__
  Displays a customizable prompt and user greetings, enhancing usability.

# Technologies Used:
__Languages:__ C
__Libraries:__ GNU Readline
__System Calls:__ fork(), execvp(), pipe(), dup2(), wait(), chdir(), getcwd()
__Development Tools:__ GCC, GDB

# Key Accomplishments:
