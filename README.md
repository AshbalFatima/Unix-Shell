# Custom Linux Shell in C
**Description:**
  Developed a custom command-line shell in C that emulates basic functionalities of Unix-like shells. This project demonstrates proficiency in C programming, system calls, and shell scripting.

# Features:

__Command Execution:__
  Supports execution of standard Unix commands and built-in commands such as cd, exit, help, and hello.
# Built-in Commands: 
  Implements built-in commands for changing directories, displaying help information, and exiting the shell.
# Pipe Handling: 
  Supports piping between commands, allowing output from one command to be used as input for another.
# Command History: 
  Integrates with the GNU Readline library to manage command history and provide command-line editing capabilities.
# User-Friendly Interface: 
  Displays a customizable prompt and user greetings, enhancing usability.
# Error Handling: 
Includes robust error handling for command execution and directory changes.

# Technologies Used:

Languages: C
Libraries: GNU Readline
System Calls: fork(), execvp(), pipe(), dup2(), wait(), chdir(), getcwd()
Development Tools: GCC, GDB
Key Accomplishments:

Implemented a functioning command-line interface with support for both simple and piped commands.
Ensured robustness through comprehensive error checking and handling.
Demonstrated practical understanding of system programming and shell architecture.
